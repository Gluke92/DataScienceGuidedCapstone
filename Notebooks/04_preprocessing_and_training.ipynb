It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "Cross validation allowed us to build k models on k sets of training data, with k estimates of ho w the model would perform,w without touching the test set. We obtained an estimate of the variability of the performance estimate within 2 std’s of the mean, at 47-86% of the data set being covered by our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We used the GridSearcCV function to help us narrow our k value down to 8. This allowed us to see a variety of very interesting coefficients and features. \n",
    "+Vertical drop is the biggest positive feature.\n",
    "+Some other features were teh area covered by snow making equipment, total chairs, fastQuads, the number of Runs, the longest Run.\n",
    "+We also found some negative features: trams, and the area covered as skiable terrain. This last one was surprising to us. It’s possible this is related to larger resorts allowing resorts to charge less per ticket, given more visitors hosted and our missing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-We then used a Random Forrest model. We found that imputing the median was helpful here, but scaling the features didn’t. We were able to marginally improve on teh default CV results by choosing the strategy of imputing the median over the mean, and by 88 specific trees, but scaling didn’t help. \n",
    "\n",
    "We made a graph to show us the importance of the random forest regressor features: fastQuads, Runs, Snow Making_ac, and vertical_drop- features that were in common with our linear model. \n",
    "\n",
    "After doing some model performance assessment via mean absolute error, we found that the random forest model had a lower cross-validation MAE by $1, with less variability. \n",
    "\n",
    "This makes the random forrest better than the linear regression model, and better than our not-model. \n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that we had enough data for it, and that the improvement of the model levels off as 40-50% of the training set was used [something around 77-96 of the values]. "
